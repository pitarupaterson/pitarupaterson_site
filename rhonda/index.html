            <li>Get Rhonda into your hands in the form of an iPad app so you can have start having as much fun drawing with it as we've been having; not to mention start making stuff we couldn't begin to imagine in our wildest dreams. This we can hardly wait to see.</li>

            <li>Build a great web-based 3D sketchbook so that the rest of the world, including us, can explore and share your Rhonda creations from the comfort of their trusty browsers.</li>

            <li>Open source Rhonda's core so that it can be taken to any number of outlandish new places by all the other uber-nerdy weirdos out there.</li>
