          <h2>
            Our ongoing goal with Rhonda is to take the best of pen & paper, and the best of technology, and smash them together.
          </h2>

          <hr>

          <ul class="">

            <li>Rhonda gives you the ability to draw in 3D.</li>

            <li>Rhonda strives to preserve the immediacy of pen & paper drawing, no matter how much technology is involved.</li>
            
            <li>Rhonda frees you from the clutter of UI, palettes, and brushes that you've unfortunately grown accustomed to. Instead Rhonda focuses your attention on a handful of powerful features that work together to extend the natural process of drawing.</li>

            <li>Rhonda is periodically updated to take advantage of exciting new hardware. We have many fantasies about where Rhonda might end up, and are working to take her there one step at a time.</li>

          </ul>

            Speaking of next steps, this is where you come in!

          </br></br>

            Help us take Rhonda to the next level by funding us on Kickstarter.
            The plan is simple:
          </h2>

          <hr>

          <ol>
            <li>Get Rhonda into your hands in the form of an iPad app so you can have start having as much fun drawing with it as we've been having; not to mention start making stuff we couldn't begin to imagine in our wildest dreams. This we can hardly wait to see.</li>

            <li>Build a great web-based 3D sketchbook so that the rest of the world, including us, can explore and share your Rhonda creations from the comfort of their trusty browsers.</li>

            <li>Open source Rhonda's core so that it can be taken to any number of outlandish new places by all the other uber-nerdy weirdos out there.</li>
          </ol>

              <p>
                We'll have enough runway to finish and release the kickass iPad version of Rhonda that we've been working on.
                </br>
                <span class="small">(We've made some really promising headway with this, but we've got a long way to go and just need the time and space to put our heads down and crack it)</span>

              <h3>If we reach 50k:</h3>
              <p>
                We'll build a web-based 3D sketchbook that will allow the rest of the world to share and explore your Rhonda creations from the comfort of their trusty browser.
                </br>
                <span class="small">(We'll build it using js and webGL so it'll work on iOS devices, and be a pretty neato piece of html5 tomfoolery in the process)</span>

            <li>
              <h3>If we reach 75k:</h3>
              <p>
                We'll extract and polish the core of Rhonda into a gleaming open-source jewel, so that anyone as excited by this stuff as we are can take it in any direction they want, and by proxy give you access to more radical Rhonda realizations.
