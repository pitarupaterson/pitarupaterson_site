      <p>

      We're a product development group with one foot in Montreal and the other in Brooklyn. Most of our time is spent trying to answer questions like: 

      </p>

      <p>


      <ul>

        <li>Could the process of creating <a href="">animation</a> ever be as immediate as playing a harmonica?</li>
        <li>Can childlike <a href="">delight</a> be bottled? </li>
        <li>What do <a href="">choreography and programming</a> have in common? </li>
        <li>Is it possible to <a href="">draw as freely in 3D space</a> as we do would with a ballpoint and a cheap piece of looseleaf?</li>
        <li>What if we could <a href="">sculpt sound</a> as though we were throwing pottery? </li>
        <li>Shouldn't there be a game that provides the same sort of <a href="">tactile reward</a> as popping a great zit?</li>
        <li>Wouldn't it be wonderful if there was an easy way to send someone a <a href="">handwritten</a> email?</li>
        <li>If we were to make <a href="">toys for our children</a> what might they be like?</li>
        <li>What's the ultimate <a href="">paper airplane</a> design?</li>
        <li>Is there <a href="">a better way to invest</a> our money?</li>
        <li>What does it feel like right before you launch?</li>

      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      We're always interested in connecting with like-minded individuals and groups, so <a href="">get in touch</a> if you have any thoughts you'd like to share, or ideas about how we might work together.
      </p>

      <p>
      We'll leave you with 2 videos that resonate  with us: One by <a href="">John Cleese on creativity</a>, and another by <a href="">Rich Hickey on problem solving</a>.
