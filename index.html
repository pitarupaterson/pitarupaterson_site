        We're a product development group with one foot in Montreal and the other in Brooklyn. Most of our time is spent trying to answer questions like: 

      </p>

      <p>


      <ul >


        <li>If you were a <a href="http://getnumby.com/">counting robot</a> with a gaggle of ghosts living in your torso, what would be your favorite song?</li>

        <!-- <li>If we were to make <a href="http://getnumby.com/">toys for our children</a> what might they be like?</li> -->

        <li>What's the best way to <a href="https://plantly.com/">understand and address risk</a> when growing your money?</li>

        <!-- <li>Is there <a href="https://plantly.com/">a better way to invest</a> our money?</li> -->
        
        <li>Is there any better place to teach than <a href="http://kitchentablecoders.com/">the kitchen table</a>?</li>

        <!-- <li></li> -->
        <li>How could you <a href="http://rhondaforever.com/">draw as freely in 3D space</a> as you would with a ballpoint and a cheap piece of looseleaf?</li>

        <li>What if we could <a href="http://sws.cc/sws2003.html">sculpt sound</a> as though we were throwing pottery? </li>

        <li>Shouldn't there be a game that provides the same sort of <a href="http://vimeo.com/3880213">tactile reward</a> as popping a great zit?</li>

        <li>Wouldn't it be wonderful if there was an easy way to send someone a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/handwritten/id452771113">handwritten</a> email?</li>
        
        <li>Could the process of creating <a href="http://insertsilence.com/aug16/">animation</a> ever be as immediate as playing a harmonica? <span class="smaller"have in common>(Sorry iOS, it's flash)</span></li>

        <li>What do <a href="http://presstube.com/i-am-a-chain-reaction/">choreography & programming</a>? </li>

        <li>Can you bottle childlike <a href="http://insertsilence.com/delight_show/">delight</a>? <span class="smaller"have in common>(Sorry iOS, it's flash)</span></li>

        <li>What's the ultimate <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RnZgozJJz0">paper airplane</a> design?</li>

        <li>What does it feel like <a href="img/how-it-feels-to-launch-big.jpg">right before you launch</a>?</li>

      </ul>
      </p>

        If you have any thoughts you'd like to share, or ideas about how we might work together, <a HREF="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%68%65%6C%6C%6F%40%70%69%74%61%72%75%70%61%74%65%72%73%6F%6E%2E%63%6F%6D">get in touch</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll leave you with 2 videos we really like: One of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VShmtsLhkQg">John Cleese on creativity</a>, and the other of <a href="http://blip.tv/clojure/hammock-driven-development-4475586">Rich Hickey on problem solving</a>.
